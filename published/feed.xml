      <content type="html" xml:base="/blog/throw-all-your-stuff-away-04-16-2017">&lt;p&gt;In the past 6 years, I’ve changed where I live a dozen times. If there’s 1 thing I learned from moving my entire belongings from one place to another twice a year, it would be: have less stuff. The less stuff you have, the easier your next move would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just sharing my experience of why and how to have as little stuff as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all live in a consumption society. We make, and at the same time spend, more money than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 6 years, I’ve changed where I live a dozen times. If there’s 1 thing I learned from moving my entire belongings from one place to another twice a year, it would be: have less stuff. The less stuff you have, the easier your next move would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I’ve trained myself this incredible skill (and still honing it every day) of throwing away stuff that I don’t need anymore. This shirt, that mug, this box, that pair of shoes…  I even come across to my friends as a huge waster as I throw away stuff that are still new or very useable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I do? If you have a principle, you’d better stick with it, or it won’t be called a principle. My entire belongings can usually be packed in 3 suitcases (1 big, 1 medium, 1 carryon) and a handbag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention I’m also a shopper holic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I don’t ask myself the question of “Would I still need this in the future?”Instead I ask “Did I use this in the past?”If the answer is no, it means you guys (you and that stuff you’re about to kiss goodbye) are just not meant to be together. Think of it like the hot guy you pass by on the street. You might be tempted to have an one night stand with him, but you know it in your heart that there’s no way this can turn into something significance. In the morning, you’d have to let him go or you’d stuck in your dream forever (like in Inception). Just let that boy leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you have to be cruel with your standard. Keep only the things you use a lot, throw the stuff you love dearly but never use/wear. Be ruthless. Your hear might skip a beat at that moment, but truth is you’d never look back on that decision. Once the item is gone, it leaves no tray behind. That’s the beauty of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, be ruthless. Do you really use all of those? Not really. So why bother?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As confessed above, I’m a shopper holic myself and shopping is in my blood. Once I go into a shop and I like 2 pairs of shoes (that I don’t even need that much), I’m taking â’em both. That’s how I’d like to treat myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that rate of shopping, I’d have to be double ruthless of throwing stuff away if I want to honor my princple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing you can do is to look at your wardrobe. That dress is really nice, but you’ve worn it once since bought. Everytime you want to put it on, there’s always a strong reason deep down from your heart saying nah maybe another time. That another time never came. Let’s face it, you guys aren’t meant to be. Give it to someone else who needs it more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have an optimal amount of clothes you should have. But you should have a collection of things you love to wear and can put on in any occasion. Of course that’s not the case for everyone. I personally like having a limited number of clothes to choose from. If something doesn’t fit my current style anymore, I’d say bye bye. Same can be applied for the rest of your possessions in your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, look through your phone. Delete all the apps you downloaded but never use. Look through your pictures, delete all the 15 selfies of your and your dog that all look the same (let’s be honest here). Do the same thing for your desktop. If you have 2 zillion of files in your desktop and download folder, it’s time to clean those up and trash most of them out. Look at your inbox, archive everything and have a zero inbox. You don’t need to look at past emails anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, look at your life. Some memories are precious and should be kept at all time. Others not so much. If this person is out of your life now, no need to keep visiting the question why he/she isn’t with me anymore. If a sad thing happens, it did. Let it go. You need to make room for new, positive and upbeat memories, and you can’t do so unless you have enough free space in your hard drive (just like your phone). Be ruthless about what you choose to keep with you here. Your time is limited, but at least you have 24 hours every day as long as you make it there. Your mind, however, is limited prime real estate. Be very careful of the planning and only grow the best things there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result: you have less stuff in your wardrobe, on your desk, in your bag, in your life. You only keep the things that you love the most at the moment. Less stuff equals less cleaning time and less time spent choosing which to use for the occasion. Less stuff means less distraction of the eyes. People say this is the century of information, the more information the better. I don’t believe so. Everyone, everyday, is overwhelmed by information. We don’t need need more information. We need less, but more quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empty your wardrobe would empty your mind, empty your soul, and give you that peace of mind you long for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This advice goes for me personally: shop less. Only buy the things you really need. Don’t by that painting so that your wall looks less empty. Try to prefer an empty wall so that you can focus on what’s off the wall (your loved ones, the book you’re reading, the project you’re working on). After a while, you start to realize that you need a lot less than you thought you do. I still have my weak spots (shoes and bags), but already improved a lot. Last time I traveled for a week and bought nothing but an apron as a gift for my sister. That’s really an accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/blog/priority-04-16-2017">&lt;p&gt;My favorite author, Murakami Haruki, once said something like this:
“I’m struck by how, except when you’re young, you really need to prioritize your life, figuring out in what order you should divide up your time and energy. If you don’t get that sort of system set by a certain age, you’ll lack focus and your life will be out of balance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22501867/25070791/39e55e60-22da-11e7-95d1-c66168e5ac9a.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s the chilled kind of author and often won’t say things to scare people away, so you’d better pay attention when he does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is it’s critical to have priorities and keep them as they are. Priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I just wanted to live life to the fullest, and that meant not missing out on anything in life. If someone asks me to go to this place/that place, I’d never say no. I was studying for finals and my friend said: Cara let’s go make some cake, or play some basketball, or watch a movie, I’d stop whatever I’m doing to do that, because the “present” is calling for me and saying no would mean not living life to the fullest. I ended up having around 7-8 friends whom I considered my best friends in the most genuine way. At the same time I didn’t really accomplish anything throughout high school and college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I grow older, I realize something’s odd. I’m not living my life to its fullest, even when I’m saying “yes” to whatever it offers me. Even the average Joe realizes he’s just average one day and starts to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Murakami said struck me hard. What are my priorities in life? Am I putting my 90% focus and energy in them? If no, then what the hell am I doing with my time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the feeling of Sunday night, when you realize weekend is all over and you haven’t done anything you set out to do on Friday night? You slept a little more than you should have so you didn’t really exercise as you wanted. You should have called your parents but when you remember it’s already midnight. You wanted to get some work done but wasted it all away looking at all people’s pictures on Facebook. You wanted to cook a home-made meal but ordered pizza to finish the last season of Desperate Housewives instead (decent show nonetheless). I’m sure it’s all happened to everyone, and it’s ok when I was young. As I grow up, it scares me to look back what what I did and realize there’s no substance in it. Did I really live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admire people who create value, invent something new, improve life quality of othersâ€¦ I want to be like them, so that later when I look back, I can pinpoint I did this and this, created this and this, made this and this 10x better. I imagine that way I’d be a lot happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how I decided to have hard, clear priorities in life.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/blog/it-will-get-better-04-16-2017">&lt;p&gt;In a training I took recently, the trainer said almost everything in a human’s body happens in a repetitive cycle: heartbeat, pulse, sleep, and of course our bowel movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22501867/25070971/0373c57a-22de-11e7-9b57-bb94705e5ee1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed the same thing with life. It wasn’t this obvious when I was younger. Life did get bad but at least I was free and could spend the night watching YouTube videos in my dorm room. As an adult, you tend to have a fuller awareness of how bad your life is at the moment and tend to remember it. So yeah, my life does get bad more noticeably as I grow up, that’s my point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the up side, it’s also more noticeable when life gets better. And I’ve noticed without a doubt, it always gets better after it got bad. I could hit bottom everyday, and would rise up undoubtedly afterward. Monday could be such a terrible day, and then I met this one person that lighted up everything. I could have this annoying customer and then meet this nice guy who is reasonable and pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again my point is, life will go down, and it’ll get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the training, the coach divides human emotions in 4 types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance zone (positive emotion - high energy): excited, enthusiastic, confident…
Renewal zone (positive emotion - low energy): calm, peaceful, grateful…
Survival zone (negative emotion - high energy): competitive, alert, defensive…
Burnout zone (negative emotion - low energy): depressed, worried, suffering…
The idea is that you should be in performance zone when working, and down to renewal zone when taking a break, then back to performance zone again. It’s not advisable to be in either survival or burnout zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have another opinion. Every human emotion is necessary (like in the movie Inside out :p). It’s impossible to just have positive energy the whole time. Rather, think of it as a cycle: you might start at performance zone, go to survival zone, down to burnout zone, and back up to renewal zone. The order could vary depending on the situation, but it’s essential to have all the 4 zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine admires Jim Rohn (even considers him his adopted father cuz he learned so much from Jim). One of his favorite talk is the Four Seasons of Life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DmCiwR4s4U/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/5DmCiwR4s4U/0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is your life operates like the four seasons: winter (hard times) then spring (recovery time) then summer (blooming time) then autumn (quiet time) then winter again. During good times you have to prepare for the hard times, and how in hard times you have to endure and keep it together and wait for the good time that will undoubtedly come afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: whenever you feel like you’re struggling and having it hard, remember that you’re just in the winter phase. Keep it low and grind through it. No need to fight hard, just try to survive. Then spring will come and it’ll get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s ok to feel like you’re running on fire and having it too rough or totally burnout and feel like $hit. Because:&lt;/p&gt;
