          <p>In the past 6 years, I’ve changed where I live a dozen times. If there’s 1 thing I learned from moving my entire belongings from one place to another twice a year, it would be: have less stuff. The less stuff you have, the easier your next move would be.</p>

<p>Just sharing my experience of why and how to have as little stuff as possible.</p>

<p>We all live in a consumption society. We make, and at the same time spend, more money than ever.</p>

<p>In the past 6 years, I’ve changed where I live a dozen times. If there’s 1 thing I learned from moving my entire belongings from one place to another twice a year, it would be: have less stuff. The less stuff you have, the easier your next move would be.</p>

<p>As a result, I’ve trained myself this incredible skill (and still honing it every day) of throwing away stuff that I don’t need anymore. This shirt, that mug, this box, that pair of shoes…  I even come across to my friends as a huge waster as I throw away stuff that are still new or very useable.</p>

<p>What can I do? If you have a principle, you’d better stick with it, or it won’t be called a principle. My entire belongings can usually be packed in 3 suitcases (1 big, 1 medium, 1 carryon) and a handbag.</p>

<p>Did I mention I’m also a shopper holic?</p>

<p>First of all, I don’t ask myself the question of “Would I still need this in the future?”Instead I ask “Did I use this in the past?”If the answer is no, it means you guys (you and that stuff you’re about to kiss goodbye) are just not meant to be together. Think of it like the hot guy you pass by on the street. You might be tempted to have an one night stand with him, but you know it in your heart that there’s no way this can turn into something significance. In the morning, you’d have to let him go or you’d stuck in your dream forever (like in Inception). Just let that boy leave.</p>

<p>Of course you have to be cruel with your standard. Keep only the things you use a lot, throw the stuff you love dearly but never use/wear. Be ruthless. Your hear might skip a beat at that moment, but truth is you’d never look back on that decision. Once the item is gone, it leaves no tray behind. That’s the beauty of it.</p>

<p>So yeah, be ruthless. Do you really use all of those? Not really. So why bother?</p>

<p>As confessed above, I’m a shopper holic myself and shopping is in my blood. Once I go into a shop and I like 2 pairs of shoes (that I don’t even need that much), I’m taking â’em both. That’s how I’d like to treat myself.</p>

<p>With that rate of shopping, I’d have to be double ruthless of throwing stuff away if I want to honor my princple.</p>

<p>First thing you can do is to look at your wardrobe. That dress is really nice, but you’ve worn it once since bought. Everytime you want to put it on, there’s always a strong reason deep down from your heart saying nah maybe another time. That another time never came. Let’s face it, you guys aren’t meant to be. Give it to someone else who needs it more.</p>

<p>I don’t have an optimal amount of clothes you should have. But you should have a collection of things you love to wear and can put on in any occasion. Of course that’s not the case for everyone. I personally like having a limited number of clothes to choose from. If something doesn’t fit my current style anymore, I’d say bye bye. Same can be applied for the rest of your possessions in your house.</p>

<p>Second, look through your phone. Delete all the apps you downloaded but never use. Look through your pictures, delete all the 15 selfies of your and your dog that all look the same (let’s be honest here). Do the same thing for your desktop. If you have 2 zillion of files in your desktop and download folder, it’s time to clean those up and trash most of them out. Look at your inbox, archive everything and have a zero inbox. You don’t need to look at past emails anyway.</p>

<p>Lastly, look at your life. Some memories are precious and should be kept at all time. Others not so much. If this person is out of your life now, no need to keep visiting the question why he/she isn’t with me anymore. If a sad thing happens, it did. Let it go. You need to make room for new, positive and upbeat memories, and you can’t do so unless you have enough free space in your hard drive (just like your phone). Be ruthless about what you choose to keep with you here. Your time is limited, but at least you have 24 hours every day as long as you make it there. Your mind, however, is limited prime real estate. Be very careful of the planning and only grow the best things there.</p>

<p>As a result: you have less stuff in your wardrobe, on your desk, in your bag, in your life. You only keep the things that you love the most at the moment. Less stuff equals less cleaning time and less time spent choosing which to use for the occasion. Less stuff means less distraction of the eyes. People say this is the century of information, the more information the better. I don’t believe so. Everyone, everyday, is overwhelmed by information. We don’t need need more information. We need less, but more quality.</p>

<p>Empty your wardrobe would empty your mind, empty your soul, and give you that peace of mind you long for.</p>

<p>This advice goes for me personally: shop less. Only buy the things you really need. Don’t by that painting so that your wall looks less empty. Try to prefer an empty wall so that you can focus on what’s off the wall (your loved ones, the book you’re reading, the project you’re working on). After a while, you start to realize that you need a lot less than you thought you do. I still have my weak spots (shoes and bags), but already improved a lot. Last time I traveled for a week and bought nothing but an apron as a gift for my sister. That’s really an accomplishment.</p>
