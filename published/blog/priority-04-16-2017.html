          <p>My favorite author, Murakami Haruki, once said something like this:
“I’m struck by how, except when you’re young, you really need to prioritize your life, figuring out in what order you should divide up your time and energy. If you don’t get that sort of system set by a certain age, you’ll lack focus and your life will be out of balance.”</p>

<p>He’s the chilled kind of author and often won’t say things to scare people away, so you’d better pay attention when he does.</p>

<p>The bottom line is it’s critical to have priorities and keep them as they are. Priorities.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I just wanted to live life to the fullest, and that meant not missing out on anything in life. If someone asks me to go to this place/that place, I’d never say no. I was studying for finals and my friend said: Cara let’s go make some cake, or play some basketball, or watch a movie, I’d stop whatever I’m doing to do that, because the “present” is calling for me and saying no would mean not living life to the fullest. I ended up having around 7-8 friends whom I considered my best friends in the most genuine way. At the same time I didn’t really accomplish anything throughout high school and college.</p>

<p>As I grow older, I realize something’s odd. I’m not living my life to its fullest, even when I’m saying “yes” to whatever it offers me. Even the average Joe realizes he’s just average one day and starts to think about it.</p>

<p>What Murakami said struck me hard. What are my priorities in life? Am I putting my 90% focus and energy in them? If no, then what the hell am I doing with my time?</p>

<p>Do you remember the feeling of Sunday night, when you realize weekend is all over and you haven’t done anything you set out to do on Friday night? You slept a little more than you should have so you didn’t really exercise as you wanted. You should have called your parents but when you remember it’s already midnight. You wanted to get some work done but wasted it all away looking at all people’s pictures on Facebook. You wanted to cook a home-made meal but ordered pizza to finish the last season of Desperate Housewives instead (decent show nonetheless). I’m sure it’s all happened to everyone, and it’s ok when I was young. As I grow up, it scares me to look back what what I did and realize there’s no substance in it. Did I really live?</p>

<p>I admire people who create value, invent something new, improve life quality of othersâ€¦ I want to be like them, so that later when I look back, I can pinpoint I did this and this, created this and this, made this and this 10x better. I imagine that way I’d be a lot happier.</p>

<p>That’s how I decided to have hard, clear priorities in life.</p>
