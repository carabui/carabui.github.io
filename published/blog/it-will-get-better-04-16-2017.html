<p>I’ve noticed the same thing with life. It wasn’t this obvious when I was younger. Life did get bad but at least I was free and could spend the night watching YouTube videos in my dorm room. As an adult, you tend to have a fuller awareness of how bad your life is at the moment and tend to remember it. So yeah, my life does get bad more noticeably as I grow up, that’s my point.</p>

<p>On the up side, it’s also more noticeable when life gets better. And I’ve noticed without a doubt, it always gets better after it got bad. I could hit bottom everyday, and would rise up undoubtedly afterward. Monday could be such a terrible day, and then I met this one person that lighted up everything. I could have this annoying customer and then meet this nice guy who is reasonable and pleasant.</p>

<p>Again my point is, life will go down, and it’ll get better.</p>

<p>In the training, the coach divides human emotions in 4 types:</p>

<p>Performance zone (positive emotion - high energy): excited, enthusiastic, confident…
Renewal zone (positive emotion - low energy): calm, peaceful, grateful…
Survival zone (negative emotion - high energy): competitive, alert, defensive…
Burnout zone (negative emotion - low energy): depressed, worried, suffering…
The idea is that you should be in performance zone when working, and down to renewal zone when taking a break, then back to performance zone again. It’s not advisable to be in either survival or burnout zone.</p>

<p>I have another opinion. Every human emotion is necessary (like in the movie Inside out :p). It’s impossible to just have positive energy the whole time. Rather, think of it as a cycle: you might start at performance zone, go to survival zone, down to burnout zone, and back up to renewal zone. The order could vary depending on the situation, but it’s essential to have all the 4 zones.</p>

<p>A friend of mine admires Jim Rohn (even considers him his adopted father cuz he learned so much from Jim). One of his favorite talk is the Four Seasons of Life</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DmCiwR4s4U/"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/5DmCiwR4s4U/0.jpg" alt="IMG" /></a></p>

<p>The idea is your life operates like the four seasons: winter (hard times) then spring (recovery time) then summer (blooming time) then autumn (quiet time) then winter again. During good times you have to prepare for the hard times, and how in hard times you have to endure and keep it together and wait for the good time that will undoubtedly come afterward.</p>

<p>Bottom line: whenever you feel like you’re struggling and having it hard, remember that you’re just in the winter phase. Keep it low and grind through it. No need to fight hard, just try to survive. Then spring will come and it’ll get better.</p>

<p>And it’s ok to feel like you’re running on fire and having it too rough or totally burnout and feel like $hit. Because:</p>
