## Hi World!

### This is Cara Bui and this is my Space! Welcome.

<div class="title-wrapper">
  <img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAgEAAAAJDllYTRiNmVkLTE2MTctNGI5OC1iMmQ1LTllNDI3ZmFmZGYxNQ.jpg" alt="" style="">

  <p><strong>Account Manager at Google</strong></p>

</div>

Marketing enthusiast with a passion for digital and technology. My experience has been 50% on the marketing side and 50% on the sales side. An entrepreneur at heart, I love challenging the status quo and constantly strive for improved efficiency.

Strength: go-to-market strategy with an ability to navigate through ambiguity - to execute, measure and scale projects with little guidance and clear KPIs.
